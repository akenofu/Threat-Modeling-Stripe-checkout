| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| T01       | An internal employee with access to source code could exfiltrate the Stripe API keys, leading to unauthorized key use to enumerate customer data via Stripe APIs and/or perform fraudulent purchases at a reduced cost (e.g., $1 items).                 |
| T02       | An external actor could exploit Stripe test cards in the production environment if the engineering team inadvertently deploys test APIs/keys in production, resulting in financial loss.                            |
| T03       | An attacker could perform a supply chain attack on a JavaScript library on the frontend, leading to a compromise that allows the injection of malicious code or the exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Stripe checkout process.              |
| T04       | An attacker could perform a supply chain attack on an npm package, leading to a compromise that allows the injection of malicious code into the microservice/application.                                                                                 |
| T05       | An attacker who discovers a misconfigured webhook handler path without authentication could exploit this to simulate purchases, resulting in financial loss.                                                                                             |
| T06       | A rogue process running on the node could intercept packets on their way to the webhook handler and replay the requests to initiate unauthorized purchases.                                                                                              |
| T07       | An external actor could leverage a race condition vulnerability to exceed the coupon limit during checkout, resulting in unauthorized discounts or financial loss.                                                                                      |
| T08       | An external actor could leverage a race condition vulnerability to add items to the cart while checking out at the same time, resulting in obtaining more items than they paid for.                                                                    |
| T09       | An attacker could tamper with the data in transit between our webserver and Stripe if the connection is not secured using TLS, leading to potential data breaches or financial fraud.                                                                  |
| T10       | A person could falsely claim they ordered an item they did not if proper auditing or logging is not in place, resulting in financial loss due to the inability to verify the claim.                                                                    |
